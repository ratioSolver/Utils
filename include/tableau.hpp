   * @brief Manage a tableau of linear expressions.
   *
   * The tableau is a map of linear expressions, where each expression is associated with a variable.
   * Formally, the tableau represents the following system of linear equations:
   *
   * `x = Ay + b`
   *
   * where `x` is the vector of variables representing the base of the tableau, `A` is the matrix of coefficients, `y` is the vector of non-basic variables, and `b` is the vector of known terms.
   * Since the tableau is usually very sparse, we use a map to represent it, having the basic variables as keys and the linear expressions as values.
   * We also keep track, for each non-basic variable, of the linear expressions that contain it, indexed by their corresponding basic variable, in order to speed up the pivot operation.
